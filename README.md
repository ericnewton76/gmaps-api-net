Google Maps API for .NET
========================

C# google maps api interface for interacting with the backend web services for Google Maps

This is the main repository for the Google Maps API for .Net

Nuget package: http://nuget.org/gmaps-api-net
```
PS> Install-Package gmaps-api-net
```

Overview
--------
This project intends to provide all the features available in the Google Maps API up to v3.7. It is being developed in C# for .NET Framework 3.5.

* Please note that this project is still in design and development phase; the libraries may suffer major changes even at the interface level, so don't rely (yet) in this software for production uses. *

Designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind, there are different libraries according to what you need.

*Google.Maps* is a full featured API client library, providing strongly typed access to the API.  

API Support
-----------

Currently the service library supports full coverage of the following Google Maps APIs:
  * *Geocoding*
  * *Elevation*
  * *Static Maps*
  * *Direction* (thanks to malke.eklam)
  * *Direction Matrix* (thanks to mocciavinc...@gmail.com)
  * *Polyline encoding* (code based on source from [http://bit.ly/5XuDqb  briancaos.wordpress.com])
  * *Google Maps for Business support*, using Google-supplied Client ID and private key for generating signed urls

Quick Examples
--------------
Using Google Maps API for .NET is designed to be really easy.

Getting an address from the Geocoding service
Let's suppose we want to search an address and get more information about it. We can write:

```c#
var request = new GeocodingRequest();
request.Address = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway";
request.Sensor = false;
var response = GeocodingService.GetResponse(request);
```

The 'GeocodingService' class submits the request to the API web service, and returns 
the response strongly typed as a `GeocodeResponse` object which may contain zero, one or more results. 
Assuming we received at least one result, let's get some of its properties:

```c#
var result = response.Results.First();

Console.WriteLine("Full Address: " + result.FormattedAddress);         // "1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA"
Console.WriteLine("Latitude: " + result.Geometry.Location.Latitude);   // 37.4230180
Console.WriteLine("Longitude: " + result.Geometry.Location.Longitude); // -122.0818530
```

Getting a static map url
Static Maps support allows you to get a valid url which you can use, for example, with an `<img src="">` tag.

```c#
var map = new StaticMapRequest();
map.Center = new Location("1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043");
map.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(400, 400);
map.Zoom = 14;
map.Sensor = false;

var imgTagSrc = map.ToUri();
```

Using a Google Maps for Business key
```c#
GoogleSigned.AssignAllServices(new GoogleSigned("gme-your-client-id", "your-signing-key"));
// Then do as many requests as you like...
var request = new GeocodingRequest { Address="1600 Amphitheatre Parkway", Sensor = false };
var response = GeocodingService.GetResponse(request);
```


Project Roadmap
---------------
The roadmap has changed a little with changing of hands, but the basic premise is the same.  
  * ~~*Geocoding API*~~
  * ~~*Elevation API*~~
  * *Static Maps* (WORKING)
  * *Documentation!* (WORKING)
  * *Sample code* (WORKING)
  * *Higher level API classes* (WORKING)
  * *Cacheability support* (WORKING)
  * *HTML helpers* -will be implemented in a tandem project for MVC and WebForms
  * *Cache implementation*
  * *Smart address search*
